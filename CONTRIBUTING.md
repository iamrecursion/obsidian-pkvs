# Contributing

This plugin started as a hacky thing to make my own life better. That said, it is public in the hope
that it might be useful to other people as well.

If you have ideas for improvements, fixes, or new features, please feel free to open an issue to
discuss. Pull requests are similarly very welcome, though I do want to keep the project small and
focused. If you are not sure if your idea would fit, please open an issue first!

All that said, thanks so much for your interest in contributing that you are looking here! Even if
you decide against it, I am really grateful you would consider it!

## Setup

To set up things such as precommit hooks and other tooling, as well as installing the necessary
dependencies, please run `npm install` first.

## Building

Building this project is as simple as `npm run build`. Please make sure you `npx prettier --write .`
before pull-requesting any changes.
